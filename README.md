# Core Systems & Architecture Implementation

A collection of high-performance system implementations focusing on resource optimization, manual memory management, and hardware-level logic.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. Instruction Set Emulator (In Progress)
- **Goal**: Developing a C-based emulator for the RISC-V ISA.
- **Key Focus**: Decoding machine instructions using bitwise operations and simulating CPU register states.

### 2. Process & Concurrency Management
- **Topic**: Low-level process lifecycle and synchronization.
- **Highlights**: Implementing robust process orchestration using Unix system calls (`fork`, `exec`, `wait`) with a focus on preventing resource exhaustion (e.g., Fork Bomb prevention).

### 3. Manual Memory & Data Structures
- **Topic**: Direct hardware-software interface optimization.
- **Highlights**: Designing zero-leak data structures using pointer arithmetic and manual memory allocation (`calloc`, `free`).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: C, C++
- **Environment**: Unix/Linux Systems
- **Concepts**: Bitwise Optimization, Memory Hierarchy, Process Scheduling
